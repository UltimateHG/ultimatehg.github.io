## Foreword
It's been a long while since I last posted because it's been kind of hard to find time in these few months, but I'm finally back with some good news. A few months back (yes I know that's quite a while ago) we got an update for the "interesting thing" I mentioned in my [last post](https://ultimatehg.github.io/article/12.html), and Microsoft rewarded us with a small bounty for it. What we found was a mp3 file with metadata that could crash windows explorer when you navigated to the folder containing the file. We expanded on it and did some analysis on what was likely to be causing the crash, so here's a short writeup on it, enjoy!

# Discovering The Crash
We realized that there was a consistent crash when we were triaging all the crashes reported by WinAFL and amazingly enough both of us managed to fuzz the same type of crash on separate machines. Since the auto-triager that we coded tested our crashes against a barebones parsing application, we thought that if it crashed there it would also potentially crash windows explorer, which reads the same `IPropertyStore` object to grab metadata. When we accessed a folder containing our `crash.mp3`, windows explorer closed on its own.

We also made sure to test it against an actual installed windows environment instead of purely testing it in VMs because there have been instances where we caught crashes that only worked within VMs. We also realized some peculiar things about the bug:
1. It does not always crash windows explorer upon navigating to the POC folder. We had some theories on this but we felt it was a memory-dependent thing that we unfortunately did not understand much as windows explorer does not always end up reading OOB or even reading the metadata at all. However, it does crash on most of the tests (>95% of our tests).
2. If the file was in the "Recent Files" section of windows explorer, it pretty much crashes windows explorer on startup.
3. The file can still be read, opened etc, it only causes a problem when its `IPropertyStore` object is parsed.

Nevertheless, we still thought it was an interesting crash so we delved deeper to try to find out exactly where it was crashing.

## Summary Of The Vulnerability
The vulnerability is present in `mfsrcsnk.dll`, which is part of the Microsoft Media Foundation framework.  
An integer underflow leads to an Out-of-Bounds (OOB) Read when parsing an MP3 frame header. The crash can be triggered by navigating into a folder containing `poc.mp3`.

## Further Analysis
The crash occurs in `mfsrcsnk.dll`: 
```shell
0:000> g
(56c8.7dc4): Access violation - code c0000005 (first/second chance not available)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.

`@r14` points to an invalid region on the heap.

## Vulnerability Analysis
At `CMP3MediaSourcePlugin::ParseHeader+0x314 (mfsrcsnk.dll+0xea04)`, the function `CMP3MediaSourcePlugin::DoScanForFrameHeader()` is called. This stores the value `0x2282` into the variable `offset`.  

```C
// buf = 0x000001c729214000, remaining_size = 0x00000000000022e6, &offset = 0x0000003fdc7ce060
hr = CMP3MediaSourcePlugin::DoScanForFrameHeader(MPEGFrame, buf, remaining_size, &offset);
```

At `CMP3MediaSourcePlugin::ParseHeader+0x20e (mfsrcsnk.dll+0xe8fe)` the variables `remaining_size` and `buf` are updated.

```C
LABEL_29:
    LODWORD(v34) = offset;
    remaining_size -= offset; // 0x00000000000022e6 - 0x0000000000002282 = 0x0000000000000064 
    buf += offset;            // 0x000001c729214000 + 0x0000000000002282 = 0x000001c729216282
    goto LABEL_30;
}
```

At `CMP3MediaSourcePlugin::ParseHeader+0x2d9 (mfsrcsnk.dll+0xe9c9)`, the function `CMP3MediaSourcePlugin::DoReadFirstFrameBody()` is called. 

```C
// buf=000001c729216282, remaining_size=0000000000000064, &offset=0000003fdc7ce060
hr = CMP3MediaSourcePlugin::DoReadFirstFrameBody(MPEGFrame, buf, remaining_size, &offset);
```

Eventually, the function `CMPEGFrame::DeSerializeFrameBody()` is called with the same arguments:
```shell
0:000> k
 # Child-SP          RetAddr               Call Site
00 0000003f`dc7cdee8 00007ffb`2629f789     mfsrcsnk!CMPEGFrame::DeSerializeFrameBody
01 0000003f`dc7cdef0 00007ffb`2629aaa1     mfsrcsnk!CMP3MediaSourcePlugin::ReadMPEGFrameBody+0x49
02 0000003f`dc7cdf60 00007ffb`2629e9ce     mfsrcsnk!CMP3MediaSourcePlugin::DoReadFirstFrameBody+0x41
0:000> r rcx, rdx, r8, r9
rcx=000001c72921bea0 rdx=000001c729216282 r8=0000000000000064 r9=0000003fdc7ce060
```

At `CMPEGFrame::DeSerializeFrameBody+0x2fe5f (mfsrcsnk.dll+0x3f15f)`, as `remaining_size` is less than `required_size`, the check fails and the function immediately returns with `HRESULT 0`. The value of `offset` is not updated and remains `0x2282`.
```C
if ( body_tag == 'ofnI' ) {
    LODWORD(required_size) = required_size + 0x74;
    if ( remaining_size < required_size ) // required_size = 0x74
        goto LABEL_22;
}
```

```C
LABEL_22:
    CallStackScopeTrace::~CallStackScopeTrace(v13);
    return hr;
}
```

At `CMP3MediaSourcePlugin::ParseHeader+0x2f7 (mfsrcsnk.dll+0xe9eb)`, the variables `remaining_size` and `buf` are updated again. However, as `remaining_size` is an `unsigned int`, an integer underflow occurs, causing `remaining_size` to store a large value. Also, `buf` now points to an invalid heap region.

```C
    LODWORD(v34) = offset;
    remaining_size -= offset; // 0x0000000000000064 - 0x0000000000002282 = 0x00000000ffffdde2
    buf += offset;            // 0x000001c729216282 + 0x0000000000002282 = 000001c729218504
```

At `CMPEGFrame::DeSerializeFrameHeader+0x39 (mfsrcsnk.dll+0xf869)`, a check is performed. Since `remaining_size` contains a large value, the check is passed. Execution flow continues, causing an OOB Read and a crash when trying to access the invalid pointer stored in `buf`.

```C
if ( remaining_size < 4 ) {
    ... // Irrelevant Code
}
v10 = *buf; // OOB Read
```

# Conclusion
In the end, it was concluded that this bug was in fact not exploitable and was an information disclosure bug. This is not to make light of information disclosure bugs but it is slightly disappointing that this was not exploitable as I would definitely have liked to do further research into actually crafting an exploit poc and popping calc.exe.

Nevertheless, this does show that fuzzing does have great potential to produce viable crashes as well as even CVEs as long as the input corpus is extensive enough (and also filtered to remove any potential garbage inputs). This was a pretty fun venture as I have never really worked with windows when it comes to security before and it was intruiging trying to figure out the internal workings of windows libraries and even the windows kernel.

# Afterword
This post has long been due and I do apologize for that but it has been really hectic these few months and I also haven't been able to do much lately in this field as serving the military really is taking up a lot more time than I predicted months ago. I will try my best to finish up any posts that I had been meaning to complete and also continue writing new posts if I ever find anything interesting, but do expect the frequency of these posts to drop by a lot.

As always, it's been a fun ride tearing my hair out analyzing the bug and its weird occasionally-not-crashing tendencies and I'm definitely happy that in the end I managed to claim a CVE for it.

But well, I suppose that's all for now. Thanks for reading.
