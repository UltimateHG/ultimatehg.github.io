<h2 id="foreword"tabindex="-1">Foreword</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve been gone for a little long this time, mainly because I took the time to finish the entire book of ‚ÄúThe C Programming Language‚Äù by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. It was a rather quick read (I guess C was not a very complex language after all), but it helped me immensely. Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader had changed a lot since the article I was following in the last article was written, and <code>JP2KLib.dll</code> also had a bit of a minor change, so I ended up having to change some things and do a bit of debugging by myself to fix the harness, and I will be covering all of that here.</p>
<h1 id="introduction"tabindex="-1">Introduction</h1>
<p>The last time I touched this, I was simply following suit along with the article ‚Äú<a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2018/50-adobe-cves-in-50-days/">50 CVEs in 50 Days</a>‚Äù. I stopped last time at <code>JP2KDecOptCreate</code>, where my function did not return the correct return value for the function. This time, with much better knowledge and more experience in debugging as well as reverse engineering the JP2K library, I decided that there were many things that I had to confirm myself to ensure that the harness would not break. I will be using windbg and IDA a lot through this post so please bear with me.</p>
<h1 id="implementing-the-nop-functions"tabindex="-1">Implementing the NOP Functions</h1>
<p>I first needed to figure out what nop4 and nop7 could possibly be, as they were both called by <code>JP2KDecOptCreate</code>. The article mentioned that they were wrappers around <code>malloc</code> and <code>memset</code>, but I had to make sure for myself. I fired up windbg and set a breakpoint at nop4 and nop7 respectively, then stepped forward one execution step at a time until eventually I arrived at the following:</p>
<p>nop4:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>eax=0ebc3db6 ebx=00000000 ecx=75e1edb0 edx=01400200 esi=75e1edb0 edi=222d65c8

79c576d7 ffd6            call    esi {ucrtbase!malloc (75e1edb0)}
</code></pre>
<p>nop7:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>eax=00000000 ebx=240ee4f0 ecx=240ee4f0 edx=11010100 esi=7a3f37c0 edi=00000058

</code></pre>
<p>There, now we know for sure that at least these 2 wrappers had not changed so I went ahead and implemented them. The <code>malloc</code> wrapper was pretty straightforward to implement, it just took in an argument for size to pass to <code>malloc</code> and returned the address that <code>malloc</code> returned. The <code>memset</code> wrapper was also pretty straightforward as it took in 3 args in the same order that <code>memset</code> accepted: <code>void* dest, int val, int size</code> in this exact order. After implementing them, I ran the harness again to make sure it was not crashing, and it worked.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>...

==&gt; nop7 (memset wrapper) called with args val:0, size:58, dest:001A1C48
JP2KDecOptCreate: ret = 001A1C48
</code></pre>
<p>The article also mentioned that nop5 and nop6 were wrappers around <code>free</code> and <code>memcpy</code> respectively, but I also had to make sure for myself:</p>
<p>nop5:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>eax=7bc6c51c ebx=00000000 ecx=79c735d0 edx=04000000 esi=79c735d0 edi=00000000

</code></pre>
<p>nop6:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>eax=0f47e6f0 ebx=0000005c ecx=7a3f3780 edx=11010100 esi=7a3f3780 edi=2410e510

</code></pre>
<p>nop5 was straightforward but nop6 wasn‚Äôt quite so, so I fired up IDA and looked into the function it was calling and sure enough, it was a memcpy wrapper:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/5xDQS5T/nop6.png"alt=""loading="lazy"decoding="async"></p>
<p>I implemented nop4, nop5, nop6 and nop7 and then moved onwards to the next functions.</p>
<h1 id="implementing-a-custom-file-stream-class"tabindex="-1">Implementing a Custom File Stream Class</h1>
<p>Following the article, I added <code>JP2KDecOptInitToDefaults</code> and passed to it the return value from <code>JP2KDecOptCreate</code>. This was definitely still the case as a quick run in windbg showed that:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>eax=240ee4f0 ebx=00000000 ecx=00000001 edx=00000058 esi=79fffb30 edi=240d3e88

</code></pre>
<p>From here, we move on to <code>JP2KImageInitDecoderEx</code>, which still took in 5 arguments, and with windbg we can easily see that it took in 2 of the return values that we got earlier:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>eax=79a150b0 ebx=240eda10 ecx=240a3948 edx=00000000 esi=7a3d8da0 edi=2410a4c4

</code></pre>
<p>In order on the stack, <code>240ea4b8</code> was the return value from <code>JP2KImageCreate</code>, followed by 2 unknown structs, <code>240ee4f0</code> was the return value from <code>JP2KDecOptCreate</code>, followed by a last unknown struct. That‚Äôs right, this function had changed since the article I was referring to was written, so it no longer took in the return value of <code>JP2KGetMemObjEx</code> as its last argument, even though <code>JP2KGetMemObjEx</code> was still called in the correct order (and a lot of times too). Weird, but we could still move on. For now, I used a placeholder for the last argument and followed what the article did to also arrive at the same conclusion: the second argument was a pointer to a file stream object and the third argument was a struct of functions that would be carried out on the second argument. Hence, I also had to create my own file object and file stream functions to pass into this function:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">typedef</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> {</span>
  FILE *fileptr;
} <span class="hljs-type">file_obj_t</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>It was just a simple struct that took in <code>FILE*</code> as its only variable. To save space and clutter, I will not be showing every single function that I created, but the filestream functions were something like these:</p>
<p><code>is_readable</code>:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">file_obj_is_readable</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">const</span> <span class="hljs-type">file_obj_t</span> *file)</span> {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;file_obj_is_readable called\n&quot;</span>);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (feof(file-&gt;fileptr)) ? <span class="hljs-number">0</span>:<span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>write</code>:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">file_obj_write</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">void</span>* fileptr, <span class="hljs-type">unsigned</span> <span class="hljs-type">char</span> *data, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> param2)</span> {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;file_obj_write called with params fileptr=%p, data=%p, param2=%d\n&quot;</span>, fileptr, data, param2);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> fwrite(data, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, param2, fileptr);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The article mentioned at one point that they realized that the <code>SEEK</code> constants were different in Adobe compared to in libc, so I had to swap them too (<code>SEEK_SET</code> and <code>SEEK_CUR</code> were swapped, same as mentioned in the article), leading me to do some sort of a mini-workaround in my seek function:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">file_obj_seek</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">void</span>* fileptr, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> offset, <span class="hljs-type">uint64_t</span> whence)</span> {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;file_obj_seek called with fileptr=%p, offset=%d, whence=%d\n&quot;</span>, fileptr, offset, whence);
  <span class="hljs-type">uint64_t</span> actual;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">switch</span> (whence) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>:
      actual = SEEK_CUR;
      <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:
      actual = SEEK_SET;
      <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>:
      actual = SEEK_END;
      <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>;
  }
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> fseek(fileptr, offset, actual);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Not the prettiest workaround, but it works. After this, I simply initialized a file_obj_t and created a struct that contained all my custom file stream functions and passed it into <code>JP2KImageInitDecoderEx</code> with the last argument still being an unknown placeholder struct. Similarly to the article, my <code>JP2KImageInitDecoderEx</code> would also return 0 only if it succeeded, so I added in a check to make sure I wasn‚Äôt continuing execution with a failed image decode. I ended up with something like this:</p>

<p>I also made sure to add in the relevant destroy functions to destroy all data if <code>JP2KImageInitDecoderEx</code> failed to decode to prevent memory leaks. After running the new harness, we could confirm that it was working:</p>

<p>It returned 0! We can now move on. This took waaaaay longer than I would‚Äôve hoped.</p>
<p><em>Common error return values that I got:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>17 - This meant that the input image was not a valid jp2 image, or was not a jp2 image at all.</p>
<p>26 - This meant that something went wrong in the process of decoding the image. Something went wrong with one or more of the file stream functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anecdote: I was tearing my hair out because <code>JP2KImageInitDecoderEx</code> kept failing for me even though I felt I had already implemented everything correctly, but it turned out that for certain file stream functions, the <em>file stream pointer itself</em> was passed directly into them instead of just the <em>custom file stream object</em>.</p>
<h1 id="implementing-the-last-functions"tabindex="-1">Implementing the Last Functions</h1>
<p>According to the article, they only had to implement <code>JP2KImageDataCreate</code>, <code>JP2KImageGetMaxRes</code> and <code>JP2KImageDecodeTileInterleaved</code>. After going through windbg and consulting some people, I believed that this still held true as a lot of the other functions that were called were likely unrelated to the parsing of JP2 images and thus were not needed in the harness.</p>
<p><code>JP2KImageDataCreate</code> and <code>JP2KImageGetMaxRes</code> were similar to in the article, I just had to call the former and pass its return value to the latter and save both return values before moving on.</p>
<p>Now began the nightmare (again, after <code>JP2KImageInitDecoderEx</code>). This function took in a massive amount of 7 arguments (hadn‚Äôt changed since the article was written) and through windbg I could double confirm that it took in the return values of <code>JP2KImageCreate</code>, <code>JP2KImageGetMaxRes</code> and <code>JP2KImageDataCreate</code>. The 2nd and 6th parameters were also found to be <code>null</code> and the 4th and 5th arguments often were <code>8</code> and <code>0xff</code> respectively so I took the article‚Äôs word that it did depend on the colour depth so I also decided to leave it as <code>8</code> and <code>0xff</code>, which left me with:</p>

<p>After running it once, it ran successfully, so I also called <code>JP2KImageDataDestroy</code>, <code>JP2KImageDestroy</code>, and <code>JP2KDecOptDestroy</code> at the end to prevent memory leaks. However‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="the-work-was-not-done"tabindex="-1">The Work was Not Done</h2>
<p>Because the library had changed over the years, when I tried running my harness in winafl I had a suspiciously low stability (&lt;80%) and also suspiciously low amount of paths (it never reached &gt;300). This meant that I was likely not hitting all the correct parsing functions, so I had to go through slowly to find out what was wrong. I realized 2 main things:</p>
<ol>
<li>When running through windbg, <code>JP2KImageDecodeTileInterleaved</code> ALWAYS returned 0, but mine would always return 8.</li>
<li>nop0 was called at the end of <code>JP2KImageDecodeTileInterleaved</code>, and even though the article mentioned nothing about implementing that, after setting a breakpoint in windbg it turned out that nop0 was likely an important parsing function as it eventually lead to multiple calls of <code>CopyRect</code> and it seemed to call many important subroutines in IDA as well.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="final-words"tabindex="-1">Final Words</h1>
<p>In the end, I still have to figure out what nop0 was exactly and implement it, as well as make sure that all my other functions were correctly harnessed. I had learnt a lot and gotten a lot more familiar with the rev-debugging process and this was definitely fun, albeit stressful and frustrating. I‚Äôm still in the process of reverse engineering the missing link in my harness, so hopefully another writeup could come soon, after I figure some things out. But I guess that‚Äôs it for now.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
