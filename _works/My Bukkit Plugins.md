# Minecraft Bukkit Plugins

**Disclaimer: These were projects that I did during COVID to play modded Minecraft with a friend because we were bored. Please take a look at the sourcecode yourself before compiling.**

**You may use these privately in any way you like. Please do NOT directly commercialize any of the plugins here. Make your own if you want to sell it for money.**

All mods go on indefinitely by default (until server is stopped) unless a stop command is provided.

### PlayerCompass
Just my own plugin for giving each player a compass pointing to a specified player.

To receive compass: `/playercompass target_player`

You may delete the compass from your inventory normally.

### BlockSwitch
Find/craft the required block within 20 minutes and stand on it before the timer expires.

To start: `/startblockswitch player1 player2`

### DeathSwap
Classic deathswap, for 2 players.

To start: `/deathswap player1 player2`

### Divine Intervention
Every 3 minutes, for all online players at time of executing start command, each player will either:
1) Receive a random bad effect
2) Teleport X blocks in a random direction
3) Have a random item in their inventory be replaced with another random item

To start: `/startdivineintervention`

### Laser Block Change
Any blocks looked at by any player would be randomly replaced with another block.

To start: `/startlbc`

To stop: `/stoplbc`

### Mob Resilience
Makes monsters much tougher.

All creepers are charged creepers :)

For each monster that is slain, all new monsters spawned gain +1.5 hp permanently.

Every time a monster takes damage, it gains 0* attack damage.

*It is currently set to 0. Please increase it as you see fit :)

To start: No commands needed. Simply place the plugin jar in your plugins folder to activate it.
